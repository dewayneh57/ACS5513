# ACS5513: Petabyte Pirates - Applied Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This repository contains code, data, and reports for the analysis and modeling of housing prices, primarily using the Ames Housing dataset and additional Zillow research data. The main objectives are:

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning
- Visualize trends and distributions in housing data
- Apply statistical tests and transformations
- Build and evaluate predictive models for house prices

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages:  
  `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `kagglehub`

Install dependencies with:
```sh
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy kagglehub
```

### Running the Main Script

1. Ensure `AmesHousing.csv` is in the project directory.
2. Run the main analysis script:
   ```sh
   python acs_5513_petabyte_pirates_project_deliverable_1.py
   ```

### Notebooks

You can open and run the Jupyter notebooks in Google Colab or locally with Jupyter Lab/Notebook.
