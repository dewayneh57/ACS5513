# ACS5513: Petabyte Pirates - Applied Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This repository contains code, data, and reports for the analysis and modeling of housing prices, primarily using the Ames Housing dataset and additional Zillow research data. The main objectives are:

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning
- Visualize trends and distributions in housing data
- Apply statistical tests and transformations
- Build and evaluate predictive models for house prices

## Repository Structure

  Main Python script for data loading, cleaning, EDA, and modeling using the Ames Housing dataset.

- **AmesHousing.csv**  
  The primary dataset used for analysis and modeling.

- **ACS_5513_Zillow_Research_Home_Value_Data.ipynb**  
Notebook for additional research and analysis using Zillow home value data.

- **Petabyte Pirates - Architectural Diagram.pptx**  
  Project architecture and workflow diagram.

- **ames_data_report.md**  
  Markdown report summarizing findings and results.

- **instructions.md**  
  Guide for running scripts and configuring your development environment.

- **Front End Web App/** and **Back End Web App/**  
  (If populated) Folders for any web application components related to the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages:  
  `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `kagglehub`

Install dependencies with:
```sh
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy kagglehub
```

### Running the Main Script

1. Ensure `AmesHousing.csv` is in the project directory.
2. Run the main analysis script:
   ```sh
   python acs_5513_petabyte_pirates_project_deliverable_1.py
   ```

### Notebooks
